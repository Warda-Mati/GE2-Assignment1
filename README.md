 World underwater with fish boids

This assignment is an underwater world, full of underwater creatures moving automounsly using steering behaviours
There isn't much a story, but it is planned to have the camera move between different creatures in the scene, having fish move 
in flocks wandering and having obstacle avoidance. it is planned to have stingrays / eels  / octupi using harmonics, as well as sharks
in which fish will flee from , while the shark will pursue the fish. Some ideas may be added or scrapped as nothing is final
